# DriverPass System Design and Business Requirements Documents
The DriverPass project was developed for DriverPass, a company that provides driver education, lessons, and practice tests.
The goal of the project was to design a system that streamlines key user interactions, such as signing up, scheduling lessons, 
making payments, and tracking progress. The system also needed to meet administrative and IT needs by including features like 
role-based access control, secure data handling, and integration with DMV updates to ensure compliance.

One of the highlights of my work on this project was designing a system that aligns with DriverPass's requirements while 
maintaining a focus on scalability and usability. I created detailed UML diagrams, including sequence, activity, and class 
diagrams, to ensure that the system’s processes were well-documented and easy for developers to follow. The technical 
architecture was another strength of the design, with recommendations for a cloud-based backend, React for the front end, Java 
for server-side logic, and MySQL for database management. These choices helped create a robust, user-friendly system that 
could handle current and future demands.

If I could revise one part of the project, I would improve the Gantt chart included in the Business Requirements Document. By 
adding more detailed task dependencies and adjusting the time estimates to be more realistic, the chart could serve as a more 
effective tool for planning and tracking the project timeline.

To address the user’s needs, I focused on building an intuitive system for all roles, including customers, drivers, 
secretaries, and administrators. The design emphasizes features like real-time scheduling, automated notifications, and secure 
data handling to provide a seamless experience. Meeting user needs is critical to ensure that the system is functional and 
user-friendly, which directly impacts its success and adoption.

When designing software, I prioritize understanding the client’s requirements and thoroughly analyzing the needs of the users. 
Using visual tools like UML diagrams helps map out the interactions within the system and ensures the design aligns with 
expectations. In the future, I would incorporate agile techniques to gather ongoing feedback and refine the design as needed 
to meet evolving requirements.
